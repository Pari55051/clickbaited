## Things I Learnt:
- you should use Github, or your projects can be lost in the abyss forever
- Github is not big/experienced devs thing, you should use it. (just creating a account doesnt count, use it!)
- making a lot of [redacted] in HTML/CSS/JS
- giving directions to people, knowing they won't follow it [for example, saying "don't read the secret readme if you don't have permanent amnesia"]
- organising a big project (this is a big project)
- resusication of old projects, adapting them for new ones
- writing readme at 2am
