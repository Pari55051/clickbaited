Are you sure you should be here??????? <sus look give to you>

<you still procded after a sus look "receival">
## Features
- click on the button for 7-15 times depening on the button's mood
- once the button feels like it, it will redirect you to a mini game

## Why I Made This
I was travelling to my hometown in the summer, and therefore had to take my (not technically "mine" mine) laptop (I use PC since the last 2 years at least) which I used once but like barely. I found some of my old projects. Projcts old enough to be considered artifacts (iykyk pun). Projects of the old old time when I wasn;t even on github.
So anyway, I found some old projects and decided that I need to do something of them. Most of them were games (in html/css/js???, career confusion existed in the olden times too). I came up with this idea of combining mini-games in one huuuggeee project, with a sidebar for navigation (yes, this was the exact idea. i remember it exactly. Q.why?  --> Ans.  idk). 

Again, recap: found old projects, do some web dev wizardry (that's my current fav word for coding btw), make one big project, with a sidebar for navigation.
Rest of it in next episode...
jk, so I started working on the project, and "Eureka!!!" (no, I was not in a bathtub unfortunately). I got this ultra cool super nice idea of a red button (i automatically relate it to something i saw back in 6th grade called "bored button", from youtube's "10 games for time pass gaming" video with the legendary bg song).

Ok, Recap: old projects --> wizardry --> big project (with a sidebar) --> let's work work work work work <insert music> --> new idea --> BIG RED BUTTON (not to be confused with Little Red Riding Hood)
so it became the red button project with a big red button, and when you click the big red button which very very very particularly specially explicitly says "don't click" enough times you are redirected to one of the mini-games randomly

> Due credit to AI: Dear ChatGPT, remind to never ask you for name sugesstions for my project ever again. I do not want my project named "Clicky.io" for the 100th time (it did show that thing in the 100000 times i told it to do better). 

So, anyhow, I somehow I ended up with the name "Clickbaited" while pitching my great idea to my siblings, which turned into joking around, which resulted in the name "Clickbaited".

And this is the story of how this project was born (kinda created, maybe I'm God for this species).......
